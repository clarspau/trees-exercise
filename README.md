# Trees Exercise

This repository contains starter code for exercises related to trees, including binary trees and n-ary trees.

## Trees

### sumValues

Given an n-ary tree of integers, this method returns the sum of all the integers in the tree.

### countEvens

Given an n-ary tree of integers, this method returns the count of all the even integers in the tree.

### numGreater

Given an n-ary tree and a number x, this method finds and returns the number of nodes in the tree which are greater than x.

## Binary Trees

### minDepth

Given a binary tree, this method finds its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### maxDepth

Given a binary tree, this method finds its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### maxSum

Given a binary tree, this method finds the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.

### nextLarger

Given a binary tree and an integer x, this method finds and returns the value of the node with the next larger element in the tree, i.e., it finds a node with a value just greater than x. It returns null if no node is present with a value greater than x.

Feel free to implement these methods and further explore tree data structures! Happy coding!
